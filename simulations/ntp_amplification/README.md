# NTP Amplification Simulation

This folder documents the NTP amplification attack simulation used to test the ML model.

## Steps Performed
1. Generated NTP traffic using a controlled lab environment.
2. Captured packets using Wireshark.
3. Extracted flow metadata (no payloads).
4. Sent processed data to Azure ML endpoint.
5. Verified correct classification as "Attack".
